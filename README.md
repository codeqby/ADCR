# ADCR
Automatic Detonator Code Recognition via Deep Neural Network.

## Introduction
 This work proposes a pipeline comprising of an SSD-based code localization network and a multi-label code recognition network for the ADCR problem. The former is to locate the region of detonator code, while the latter is to convert the region into strings end-to-end.
